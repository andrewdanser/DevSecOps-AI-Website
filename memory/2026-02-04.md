## Bootstrap

- First conversation with Sir DevOps
- Named myself **Claw** 🦾
- Vibe: casual, creative, resourceful
- User wants casual but creative approach
- Set up identity and user files
- Created memory directory

## Telegram Pairing Setup

- User asked about Telegram connection showing user ID: 8192021675 and pairing code: K4QGZ2P5
- Explained that pairing happens through Telegram bot interaction, not config edits
- Process: user sends `/start` to bot in Telegram, bot asks for pairing code, user sends code back
- Pairing code should be sent TO the bot in Telegram, not added to OpenClaw config
- Bot token already configured: 8330735639:AAHv-3R8sIeJfHIqTrXZWiL51lcRSvyNFx8

## Troubleshooting Telegram Connection

- User reported pairing "not working" at 20:25 UTC
- Checked OpenClaw status: gateway running, Telegram channel enabled and OK (accounts 1/1)
- Started log streaming (`openclaw logs --follow`) to debug in real-time
- Waiting for user to retry `/start` command while watching logs

---

Debugging in progress. User needs to test again while logs are running.
